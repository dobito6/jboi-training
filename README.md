#JBOI training 
This repository contains some of the tasks used for training the Bulgarian JBOI
team. There were two training competitions each with three tasks and four hours
long. The tasks aren't original, they are taken from other competitions or
training websites. We have however translated the statements in bulgarian,
created tests when needed and created example solutions.

##Sources
As mentioned before the tasks aren't authored by us.
